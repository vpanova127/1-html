<p>The work of Bureau Borsche seems to float effortlessly between contradictory worlds: the broad appeal of corporate clients such as Nike and BMW; the avant-garde experimentalism of the art world; and the luxurious conceptualism of fashion brands such as Balenciaga. In all of these spheres, Borsche’s typography and art direction shines through, always fresh and always relevant. Other clients include Zeit Magazin and Kaleidoscope magazine, as well as the German daily newspaper Die Zeit, which Borsche himself creative directs.</p>
